# OpenPEM
Open-Source Personal Exposure Monitor - PM2.5

# What is OpenPEM? 
OpenPEM is an Open-Source hardware for continuous monitoring of personal expsoure to PM2.5. The hardware includes a MCU board and a PM sensor from sensirion. We have used an SPS30 which is basically an Optical Particle Counter. OpenPEM sends alerts to the users via BLE when tbe expsoure levels exceeds.

Exposure to fine particles can also affect lung function and worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease. Scientific studies have linked increases in daily PM2.5 exposure with increased respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions, emergency department visits and deaths. Studies also suggest that long term exposure to fine particulate matter may be associated with increased rates of chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function and increased mortality from lung cancer and heart disease. People with breathing and heart problems, children and the elderly may be particularly sensitive to PM2.5.
